# Smart-Product-Review-Analyzer

## Multi-Modal Data Analysis and Predictive Insights

This project involves analyzing and deriving insights from a dataset combining text data (product reviews) with numerical metadata. The workflow includes feature extraction, sentiment analysis, predictive modeling, and data visualization to provide actionable insights about product ratings.

## Objective
The main objectives of this project are:
- To preprocess and analyze textual data from product reviews.
- To extract features such as sentiment scores, key phrases, and topics.
- To integrate textual features with numerical metadata for multi-modal analysis.
- To develop a predictive model to forecast product ratings and visualize insights.

## Dataset
The project utilizes the [Fine Food Reviews Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/snap/amazon-fine-food-reviews), which includes:
- **Text reviews**: User feedback in text format.
- **Metadata**: Product ratings, helpfulness votes, and other numerical data.

---

## Steps and Methodology

### 1. Data Preprocessing
- Cleaned text by removing URLs, special characters, and excessive whitespaces.
- Converted text to lowercase and applied tokenization, stopword removal, and lemmatization.

### 2. Sentiment Analysis
- Calculated sentiment polarity scores using the `TextBlob` library.
- Extracted key phrases using TF-IDF vectorization.

### 3. Topic Modeling
- Performed Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to identify key topics in reviews.

### 4. Feature Engineering
- Combined textual features (sentiment scores, key phrases) with numerical metadata.
- Engineered additional features from the dataset.

### 5. Predictive Modeling
- Developed and optimized a Gradient Boosting Regressor to predict product ratings, achieving an RÂ² score of 0.89 and Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 0.36.
- Split data into training and testing sets and evaluated model performance using metrics like MSE and R-squared.

### 6. Visualization
- Created visualizations to illustrate:
  - Sentiment scores vs. product ratings.
  - Feature importance in the predictive model.
  - Distribution of actual vs. predicted ratings.

## Results and Visualizations

### Key Visualizations
- **Residual Plot**: Highlights the difference between actual and predicted ratings.
- **Feature Importance**: Shows the significance of each feature in the model.
- **Distribution Plot**: Compares the distribution of actual vs. predicted ratings.
